A visual navigation system based on convolutional neural networks (CNN) enables the Qbot robot to autonomously follow a path in a fixed scene. It adopts a dual-model architecture: a classification CNN identifies the type of location the robot is in (straight path, curve, etc.) to drive decision-making; a regression CNN precisely calculates the deviation of the movement trajectory and generates control instructions in real time for offset compensation. By processing a large amount of data with OpenCV to train the model, the prediction error is less than 0.1%, ultimately achieving high-precision and robust path-following operation.
